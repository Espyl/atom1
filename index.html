<h2>Atom이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<p>An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom" target="_blank" title="wikipedia atom refrence">atom</a> is the <strong>smallest constituent <u>unit</u> </strong> of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element. Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or ionized atoms. Atoms are very small; typical sizes are around 100 picometers (a ten-billionth of a meter, in the short scale).</p><img src="atom.jpg" width="1000px"><p style="margin-top:45px;">Atoms are small enough that attempting to predict their behavior using classical physics – as if they were billiard balls, for example – gives noticeably incorrect predictions due to quantum effects. Through the development of physics, atomic models have incorporated quantum principles to better explain and predict the behavior.</p>
